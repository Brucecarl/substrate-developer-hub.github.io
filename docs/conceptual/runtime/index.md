## Substrate Runtime

The runtime is the most critical component in a blockchain. 
It contains the business logic that will define the blockchain's behavior. 
It becomes part of the primary function, which will govern the transition to a new state.

Substrate [FRAME](frame) provides a set of modules (called pallets) and support libraries that make blockchain runtime development as flexible and easy as possible.

If you don't want to use the FRAME helpers, you can still write your own interfaces to interact with the Substrate client and implement your custom runtime.
